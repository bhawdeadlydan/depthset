# Depthset
 - Depth image dataset generator from 3D models.
 - Generates big datasets for machine learning research using obj and stl files.

## Usage
 - Clone the repo.
 - Install dependencies by running 'npm install'.
 - Copy obj and stl files to the data folder.
 - Run the program by calling 'npm run start'.
 - Results will be written to the output folder.

## Configuration
 - In the main.js file its possible to configure the following parameters
    - input = Input folder
    - output = Output folder
    - resolution = Resolution of the images (256 px by default)
    - repetions = How many repetitions with different rotation for each model (10 by default)
    - drawImages = If the images should appear on the window for preview (false by default)
    - near = Camera near plane (0.3 by default)
    - far = Camera far plane (2.0 by default)
    - fov = Camera field of view (60.0 by default)
    - distance = Camera distance to the model (1.2 by default)
